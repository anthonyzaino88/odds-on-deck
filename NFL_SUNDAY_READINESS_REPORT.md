## 1. Will We Have NFL Games on Sunday?

### ‚úÖ YES - Automatic NFL Schedule Fetching

**How it works:**
- ESPN API fetches current week NFL games automatically
- Updates every time you refresh the home page
- No manual intervention needed

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
// lib/data-manager.js - Line 54-56
const [mlbGames, nflGames, picks, playerProps] = await Promise.all([
  getTodaysMLBGames(),
  getThisWeeksNFLGames(),  // <-- Automatically fetches this week's NFL games
  generateEditorPicks(),
  useRealPropOdds ? generatePlayerPropsWithRealOdds() : generatePlayerProps()
])
```

**What happens on Sunday morning:**
1. You open the app ‚Üí triggers `getAllData()`
2. System calls `getThisWeeksNFLGames()` ‚Üí fetches from ESPN
3. ESPN returns Week 6 Sunday games (currently 13 games scheduled)
4. Games appear on homepage automatically

**Verification Code:**
```javascript
// lib/vendors/nfl-stats.js
export async function fetchNFLSchedule(week = null, seasonYear = null) {
  let url = `${ESPN_NFL_BASE}/scoreboard` // Gets current week automatically
  const res = await fetch(url)
  const data = await res.json()
  return mapNFLScheduleData(data)
}
```

  // 1. Fetch MLB props
  const mlbProps = await generateMLBPlayerProps()
  
  // 2. Fetch NFL props
  const nflProps = await generateNFLPlayerProps()
  
  // 3. Combine and return
  return [...mlbProps, ...nflProps]
}

## 6. Known Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Won't Affect Sunday):

   - Not using advanced NFL stats APIs
   - Projections based on season averages + randomization
   - Still generates realistic props (240-300 pass yards, etc.)

2. **No Real Player Prop Odds**
   - Current plan: The-Odds-API doesn't include player props
   - Workaround: We estimate odds at -110 (standard)
   - Game lines (spreads, totals, ML) are real

3. **Limited Historical Data**
   - First week of NFL tracking
   - Validation system just getting started
   - Will improve week-over-week
