## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd odds-on-deck
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure your settings:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:

```env
# App Configuration
APP_NAME="Odds on Deck"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/oddsondeck"

# APIs
ODDS_API_KEY="your_odds_api_key_here"

# Next.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_secret_here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 3. Database Setup

Generate Prisma client and run migrations:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Seed the database with initial team data:

```bash
npm run seed
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

### 5. Initial Data Load

Load today's games and odds data:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/refresh-slate
```

Or visit the endpoint in your browser to trigger the data refresh manually.

## üìä Usage

### Today's Slate

Navigate to `/games` to see:
- All scheduled MLB games for today
- Probable starting pitchers
- Market totals vs model projections
- Moneyline and total betting edges
- Last updated timestamps

### Game Details

Click on any game to view:
- Detailed team and pitcher information
- Park factors and environmental conditions
- Batter vs pitcher matchup analysis
- Odds movement history from multiple books

### DFS Rankings

Visit `/dfs` for:
- Hitter and pitcher value rankings
- Projected fantasy points
- Value calculations (projection √∑ salary)
- Team contexts and matchup notes

## üîÑ Data Pipeline

The application runs automated data collection via the refresh-slate cron job:

1. **Teams & Players**: Fetches MLB rosters and basic player data
2. **Schedule**: Gets today's games with probable pitchers
3. **Odds**: Collects real-time betting lines from US sportsbooks
4. **Edge Calculation**: Runs matchup model to compute betting edges
5. **Storage**: Persists all data with timestamps for historical analysis

### Manual Refresh

Trigger data updates manually:

```bash
# Development
curl http://localhost:3000/api/cron/refresh-slate

# Production
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/cron/refresh-slate
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode during development:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Test coverage includes:
- Utility functions (odds conversion, edge calculation)
- API endpoints (data ingestion, game details)
- Core business logic (matchup modeling)

## üóÑ Database Schema

Key models:

- **Team**: MLB teams with park factors
- **Player**: Players with handedness and position data
- **Game**: Individual games with probable pitchers
- **Odds**: Betting lines with timestamps for history
- **SplitStat**: Player performance splits (vs L/R, recent form)
- **PitchMix**: Pitcher repertoire and effectiveness data
- **EdgeSnapshot**: Model outputs and betting edges

View the database:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

## üîß Configuration

### Vercel Cron Setup

For production deployment, add to `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/refresh-slate",
      "schedule": "0 */15 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs data updates every 15 minutes during game days.

### API Rate Limits

The Odds API has usage limits on free plans:
- 500 requests/month (free tier)
- Consider caching strategies for production use
- Monitor usage in The Odds API dashboard

### Vendor Layer

The application uses a vendor abstraction layer in `lib/vendors/` for easy API swapping:

- **Current**: MLB Stats API (free) + The Odds API
- **Upgrade Path**: Sportradar, SportsDataIO, or other premium providers
- **Interface**: Consistent data mapping regardless of source

To swap providers, implement the same interface in new vendor files.

## üì± Mobile Support

The application is fully responsive and works on mobile devices:
- Touch-friendly navigation
- Responsive tables with horizontal scrolling
- Optimized layouts for small screens
- Fast loading with SSR
