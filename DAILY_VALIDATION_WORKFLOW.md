# Daily Validation Workflow

## ✅ Complete Solution Confirmed Working!

### What Was Fixed:
1. Enhanced game lookup to check `oddsApiEventId` field
2. Added detailed logging for troubleshooting
3. Identified the workflow issue: games must be marked "final" before validation

---

## 📋 Daily Workflow for Validation

### **Step 1: Update Game Statuses** (Mark finished games as final)
```bash
node scripts/update-scores-safely.js nhl
node scripts/update-scores-safely.js nfl
```

**This updates:**
- Game scores
- Game status (in_progress → final)
- Allows validation system to process completed games

---

### **Step 2: Run Validation Check** (Process pending props)
```powershell
# Via PowerShell:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/validation/check" -Method POST -UseBasicParsing

# Or visit dashboard and click "Check Validations" button:
# http://localhost:3000/validation
```

**This processes:**
- Finds pending props
- Looks up games (now marked as final)
- Fetches actual stats from ESPN
- Marks props as correct/incorrect
- Updates overall stats

---

### **Step 3: View Results**
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/validation`

**You'll see:**
- Updated win rates
- ROI calculations
- Completed props by sport
- Performance by prop type

---

## 🎯 Today's Test Results

**Before Fix:**
- 12 pending validations
- 0 updated
- Games stuck as "in_progress"

**After Fix:**
- 12 pending validations
- ✅ 10 updated
- ✅ 2 remaining (today's scheduled games)
- ✅ 0 errors

---

## 🔄 Automated Workflow (Optional)

### Option 1: Manual Daily Routine
Run these 2 commands each morning after games finish:
```bash
# 1. Update scores
node scripts/update-scores-safely.js nhl
node scripts/update-scores-safely.js nfl

# 2. Run validation
# (visit dashboard and click button)
```

### Option 2: Combined Script
Create `scripts/daily-validation.js`:
```javascript
import { exec } from 'child_process'
import { promisify } from 'util'

const execAsync = promisify(exec)

async function dailyValidation() {
  console.log('🔄 Step 1: Updating scores...')
  await execAsync('node scripts/update-scores-safely.js nhl')
  await execAsync('node scripts/update-scores-safely.js nfl')
  
  console.log('🔄 Step 2: Running validation...')
  await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/validation/check', { method: 'POST' })
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(console.log)
  
  console.log('✅ Daily validation complete!')
}

dailyValidation().catch(console.error)
```

Then run:
```bash
node scripts/daily-validation.js
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If validations don't update:

1. **Check game statuses:**
```sql
-- In Supabase:
SELECT id, status, sport, date, "homeTeam", "awayTeam"
FROM "Game"
WHERE sport = 'nhl' AND date < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

2. **Check terminal logs:**
Look for:
- `✅ Found by id` (good - game found)
- `⏳ Game not finished yet` (bad - needs score update)
- `🏁 Game is final` (good - ready to validate)

3. **Verify ESPN API is working:**
```bash
# Test fetching NHL stats:
node scripts/update-scores-safely.js nhl
# Should show final scores
```

---

## 📊 Expected Validation Stats

After running validation regularly for a week, you should see:

- **Win Rate**: 45-55% (realistic for sports betting)
- **ROI**: -5% to +15% (break-even is 52.4% at -110 odds)
- **Completed Props**: Growing daily
- **By Sport**: Separate stats for NHL, NFL, MLB

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know the system is working when:

1. ✅ Pending validations decrease after running check
2. ✅ Completed validations increase
3. ✅ Dashboard shows NHL props in "Completed Props History"
4. ✅ "Performance by Prop Type" shows NHL stats
5. ✅ "Source Tracking" shows props from saved parlays

---

## 🎉 System Status: WORKING!

- ✅ Mobile nav has validation link
- ✅ Game lookup enhanced (checks 5 ID fields)
- ✅ Logging added for troubleshooting
- ✅ Tested with NHL props - 10/12 validated successfully
- ✅ Stats calculations working correctly

**Ready for production use!** 🚀
