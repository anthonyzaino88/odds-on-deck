# Daily Operations Guide - What Happens Every Day

## 🎯 **REALITY CHECK: Daily Data Changes**

You're absolutely correct! The app won't always have the same games. Here's what actually happens:

### **📅 DAILY AUTOMATIC OPERATIONS**

#### **Every Day at Midnight (UTC):**
1. **New Games Added**: MLB/NFL schedules automatically fetch tomorrow's games
2. **Old Games Removed**: Yesterday's games are archived or removed
3. **Fresh Lineups**: New batting orders and rosters for today's games
4. **Updated Props**: Player props generated for today's active games
5. **Live Scoring**: Real-time updates for games that are actually playing

#### **Every 15 Minutes:**
1. **Live Data Refresh**: Scores, innings, game status updates
2. **Lineup Updates**: If lineups change (late scratches, etc.)
3. **Props Recalculation**: Edge calculations updated with live data
