# üèí NHL Games Missing - Quick Fix

## Problem
NHL games are not showing on the homepage, live scoring, or Today's Slate page.

## Root Cause
NHL games haven't been fetched from the ESPN API and stored in the database yet.

## Solution
Call the new NHL fetch endpoint to populate the database with today's NHL games.

## üöÄ How to Fetch NHL Games (2 Options)

### Option 1: Using Your Browser
1. Open this URL in your browser after deployment finishes (2-3 minutes):
   ```
   https://odds-on-deck.vercel.app/api/nhl/fetch-games
   ```

2. You'll see a JSON response like:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "gamesAdded": 12,
     "teamsAdded": 32,
     "message": "Fetched 12 NHL games and 32 teams"
   }
   ```

3. Refresh your homepage - NHL games will now appear!

### Option 2: Using PowerShell/Terminal
Run this command:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://odds-on-deck.vercel.app/api/nhl/fetch-games" -Method GET
```

Or using curl (if installed):
```bash
curl https://odds-on-deck.vercel.app/api/nhl/fetch-games
```

## üîÑ When to Re-fetch

You should re-fetch NHL games:
- ‚úÖ **Daily** - to get new games scheduled for today
- ‚úÖ **After midnight** - to get the next day's slate
- ‚úÖ **When games are missing** - if you notice no NHL games showing

---

## ü§ñ Automatic Fetching

The NHL fetch is also included in:
- `/api/cron/refresh-slate` - Full slate refresh (MLB + NFL + NHL)
- `/api/cron/auto-refresh` - Automatic hourly refresh
- `/api/data` with `force=true` - Manual refresh button

But those are rate-limited to protect your Odds API quota!

## üèí Today's NHL Games (Oct 31, 2025)

Check ESPN to see which games are scheduled tonight:
https://www.espn.com/nhl/scoreboard

Typical Thursday night slate: **8-12 games**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Still no NHL games after fetching?

1. **Check the API response** - Did it say `"gamesAdded": 0`?
   - Might mean no NHL games are scheduled today
   - Check ESPN scoreboard to verify

2. **Check team IDs** - NHL teams use `NHL_` prefix
   - Teams: `NHL_1`, `NHL_2`, etc.
   - Games reference these team IDs

3. **Check game status**
   - Games must be `scheduled`, `pre_game`, `in_progress`, or `final`
   - Old/canceled games are filtered out

4. **Clear cache** - Refresh your browser with Ctrl+Shift+R

### Games showing but no odds?

That's expected right now - your Odds API is at its free tier limit until Nov 1st.
The games will show, but odds might be missing until the API resets.
