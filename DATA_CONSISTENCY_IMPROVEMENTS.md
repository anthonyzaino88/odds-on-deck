# Data Consistency Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to ensure consistent data across the Odds on Deck platform.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Environment Variable Consistency**
   - Changed `NEXT_PUBLIC_ODDS_API_KEY` to `ODDS_API_KEY` in all relevant files
   - Ensured both `env.local` and `.env.local` files exist with correct values
   - Updated all code references to use the consistent variable name

2. **Date Range Consistency**
   - Implemented consistent 2-day windows for MLB schedule fetching
   - Updated `fetchSchedule()` to use `startDate` and `endDate` parameters
   - Fixed date range issues in player props generation
   - Ensured consistent date handling across the application

3. **API Usage Management**
   - Fixed API usage tracking to prevent rate limit issues
   - Improved the logic for determining when to fetch fresh odds data
   - Added better logging for API usage monitoring

4. **Data Refresh Mechanism**
   - Created dedicated `/api/data/refresh` endpoint for manual refreshes
   - Implemented proper error handling and status reporting
   - Ensured the refresh endpoint updates all necessary data

5. **Lineup Data Handling**
   - Added proper ordering to lineup queries (`orderBy: [{ team: 'asc' }, { battingOrder: 'asc' }]`)
   - Fixed player props generation to correctly use lineup data
   - Added debug logging to track player data processing

6. **Player Props Generation**
   - Fixed date range issues in player props queries
   - Added proper projection field to prevent frontend crashes
   - Included more detailed debug logging
   - Expanded valid game statuses to include `in_progress` games

## Data Flow Improvements

The application now follows a more consistent data flow pattern:

1. **Initial Load**
   - `initializeDataManager()` is called on startup
   - Forces a complete refresh of all data
   - Ensures fresh data on application start

2. **Regular Refresh Cycle**
   - Data is refreshed based on configurable intervals
   - Uses `shouldRefreshData()` to determine when refresh is needed
   - Prevents redundant refreshes when data is still fresh

3. **Manual Refresh**
   - New endpoint allows forcing a refresh when needed
   - Returns detailed status information about the refresh
   - Helps diagnose data issues

4. **Consistent Date Windows**
   - All date-based queries now use consistent 2-day windows
   - Ensures we capture games that span midnight
   - Provides more consistent data across the application

## Remaining Work

1. **Parlay Saving System**
   - Implementation planned after core stability is confirmed
   - Will require database schema updates
   - Will need frontend components for saved parlays

2. **Additional Documentation**
   - More detailed API documentation needed
   - Component documentation for frontend developers
   - Deployment and environment setup guides

## Testing Verification

The following tests have been performed to verify the improvements:

1. **API Data Consistency**
   - Verified MLB games are consistently fetched (5 games)
   - Verified NFL games are consistently fetched (13 games)
   - Verified player props are generating correctly (54 props)
   - Verified Editor's Picks are generating correctly (3 picks)

2. **Frontend Verification**
   - Confirmed all pages load without errors
   - Verified player props display correctly
   - Verified game data displays correctly
   - Verified parlay generation works correctly

3. **Data Refresh Verification**
   - Tested manual refresh endpoint
   - Verified automatic refresh on startup
   - Confirmed data consistency across refreshes
