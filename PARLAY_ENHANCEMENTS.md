## Live Odds Confirmation ✅

**YES, we are pulling live odds!**

**Source:** The-Odds-API  
**What we fetch:**
- ✅ Moneyline odds (real-time)
- ✅ Spread/Runline odds (real-time)
- ✅ Over/Under totals (real-time)
- ✅ Multiple sportsbooks (best lines)
- ✅ Line movement tracking
- ⚠️ Player props are ESTIMATED at -110 (not live)

**Why player props aren't live:**
The-Odds-API doesn't include player prop odds in our subscription tier. We estimate them at standard -110 odds and calculate our own fair value based on player projections and stats.

**Refresh frequency:**
- Odds: Every 15 minutes during active games
- Games: Every 5 minutes
- Live scores: Every 30 seconds during in-progress games

## How Percentages Are Calculated

### Edge (Your Advantage)
```javascript
Edge = (Our Probability - Market Probability) / Market Probability

Example:
- Our model: 60% chance to win
- Market odds: -110 (52.4% implied)
- Edge = (0.60 - 0.524) / 0.524 = 14.5%
```

### Probability (Win Chance)
```javascript
For parlays: Multiply all leg probabilities

Example 3-leg parlay:
- Leg 1: 65% (0.65)
- Leg 2: 60% (0.60)  
- Leg 3: 70% (0.70)
- Parlay: 0.65 × 0.60 × 0.70 = 27.3%
```

### Expected Value (Long-term Profit)
```javascript
EV = (Win Probability × Payout) - (Loss Probability × Stake)

Example:
- +250 odds (pays $2.50 per $1)
- 30% chance to win
- EV = (0.30 × 2.50) - (0.70 × 1) = +$0.05

Meaning: Win $5 per $100 bet over many trials
```
