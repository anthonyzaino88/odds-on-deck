# 🚀 START HERE: Validate Your NHL Props in 5 Minutes

## ✅ **Easiest Method: Prisma Studio**

You already have Prisma Studio open at **http://localhost:5555**

---

## 📝 **Step-by-Step (Takes 2 mins per prop)**

### **1. Open Prisma Studio**

Go to: http://localhost:5555

### **2. Click "PropValidation" in the sidebar**

### **3. Add a filter:**

Click the filter icon (funnel) and add:
- **Field:** `status`
- **Operator:** `equals`
- **Value:** `invalid`

You'll see all the invalid props.

### **4. Pick ONE prop to start:**

Example: Click on the first row

### **5. Look up the player's game from last night:**

**Quick way:**
1. Open Google
2. Search: `[Player Name] stats October 17 2025`
3. Or go to: https://www.espn.com/nhl/scoreboard/_/date/20251017

**Example:** For "David Pastrnak"
- Google: "David Pastrnak stats October 17"
- Find his game (Boston Bruins)
- See his stats: **2 assists, 1 goal, 5 shots**

### **6. Update the prop:**

In Prisma Studio, click the prop row to edit:

**Fill in these fields:**
- `actualValue`: The actual stat (e.g., 2 for 2 assists)
- `result`: 
  - `"correct"` if your prediction was right
  - `"incorrect"` if it was wrong
  - `"push"` if it tied exactly
- `status`: Change to `"completed"`
- `completedAt`: Type today's date (2025-10-18)
- `notes`: Short note like "Had 2 assists vs BUF"

**How to know if correct/incorrect:**

```
If predicted OVER 0.5 assists:
- Actual was 2 assists → CORRECT ✅ (2 > 0.5)
- Actual was 0 assists → INCORRECT ❌ (0 < 0.5)

If predicted UNDER 2.5 shots:
- Actual was 2 shots → CORRECT ✅ (2 < 2.5)
- Actual was 5 shots → INCORRECT ❌ (5 > 2.5)
```

### **7. Click "Save Changes"**

### **8. Repeat for 5-10 more props!**

## 🎯 **Real Example**

Let's do ONE complete example:

### **The Prop:**
```
Player: Connor McDavid
Type: goals
Prediction: OVER 0.5
Threshold: 0.5
Status: invalid
```

### **Look up stats:**
- Google: "Connor McDavid stats October 17"
- Result: He scored **2 goals** last night

### **Determine result:**
```
Prediction: OVER 0.5 goals
Actual: 2 goals
Is 2 > 0.5? YES ✅
Result: CORRECT
```

### **Update in Prisma Studio:**
```
actualValue: 2
result: "correct"
status: "completed"
completedAt: 2025-10-18
notes: "Had 2 goals in EDM vs NYI game"
```

### **Save!** ✅

## 📊 **After You Validate 10 Props**

Check your updated stats:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/validation/check" -Method GET
```

You should see:
```
Completed: increased! (was 231, now 241+)
Correct: increased! (was 77, now 85+)
Accuracy: updated! (was 33.3%, now 35%+)
```

**Your ML system is learning!** 🧠

## 🎯 **Pro Tips**

### **Priority Order:**

Validate props in this order:
1. **Your own saved parlays** (most important!)
2. **High-value props** (big edges, high confidence)
3. **Popular players** (McDavid, Matthews, MacKinnon)
4. **Recent props** (last 2-3 days)

### **Batch by Team:**

Do all Boston Bruins props at once:
1. Look up BOS game once
2. Get all player stats from that game
3. Update all BOS props together

### **Use NHL.com if ESPN is slow:**

https://www.nhl.com/scores/2025-10-17
- Click on game
- "Box Score" tab
- All players listed
