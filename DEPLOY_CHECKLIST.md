## 🔄 Vercel Auto-Deployment

Your code is now deploying automatically to Vercel!

**Monitor deployment:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your `odds-on-deck` project
3. Watch the deployment progress

**Expected deployment time:** 2-3 minutes

---

## ⚙️ Vercel Configuration Check

Make sure these environment variables are set in Vercel:

### Required Variables
```
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://[your-vercel-postgres-connection-string]
ODDS_API_KEY = [your-odds-api-key]
USE_REAL_PROP_ODDS = true
```

### How to Check/Set:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Make sure all 3 variables are set
3. Make sure they're applied to **all environments** (Production, Preview, Development)

---

## 📊 Database Migration

Your schema is already set to PostgreSQL, and the build script will run migrations automatically.

**Build process:**
```bash
prisma generate         # Generates Prisma Client
prisma migrate deploy   # Runs migrations on production DB
next build             # Builds Next.js app
```

This happens automatically during Vercel deployment.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails

**Check Vercel deployment logs:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click latest deployment
2. View Build Logs
3. Look for errors

**Common issues:**
- ❌ DATABASE_URL not set → Add in Environment Variables
- ❌ Prisma migration failed → Check DATABASE_URL format
- ❌ Build timeout → Check Function logs

### If Site Loads But Shows Errors

**Check Function Logs:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Click deployment
2. Click "View Function Logs"
3. Look for runtime errors

**Common issues:**
- ❌ "Cannot connect to database" → Check DATABASE_URL
- ❌ "ODDS_API_KEY not found" → Add environment variable
- ❌ "No games found" → Database needs seeding

---

## 📝 First-Time Deployment Notes

If this is your first deployment to Vercel with PostgreSQL:

### 1. Database is Empty
Your production database is empty. You need to:
- Wait for games to be fetched (happens automatically)
- Or manually trigger data refresh

### 2. No Validation Data Yet
The 136 validated props from your local database are NOT in production.
- This is normal
- New validations will populate as games finish
- Tonight's NFL game will add ~150 validations

### 3. Seed Teams (Optional)
If you see "No teams found" errors:
```bash
# Connect to production database and seed
DATABASE_URL="your_production_url" npm run seed
```

---
